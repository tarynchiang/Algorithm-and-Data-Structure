#Takes as input two parameters:

# priceList is a list of integers that represents today's cost for a single order of
#  chicken nuggets for every quantity between 0 and the length of the priceList - 1.
#  So the element at index 0 should always be 0, the element at index 1 is the cost of
#  ordering a single chicken nugget, the element at index 2 is the cost of an order of
#  two chicken nuggets, and so on.

# numNuggets is an integer, representing the total number of chicken nuggets you need to
#  order today to send the intended message to your shadow organization

# Returns a list of integers, where each integer is the number of chicken nuggets in an order,
#  and the whole list represents the lowest cost set of orders which total to numNuggets.
